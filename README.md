Start with `Neural-Modeling/setup/README.md` to get started with installing `miniconda`, creating an environment, and installing necessary packages.

`notebooks/AA_pre_sim.ipynb` is the core example for designing simulations. A folder will be created for the set of designed simulations with folders inside for each simulation in the path `Neural-Modeling/simulations/{simulations_set}/{simulation}`.

`notebooks/AA_reduction.ipynb` is an example of designing reduced cell simulations.

`notebooks/AA_sim.ipynb` will simulate the specified simulations.

`notebooks/AA_post_sim.ipynb` is used to analyze simulated data.
